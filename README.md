# MasterThesis

Repository of master thesis code.  I use the US census bureau's SIPP (Survey of Income and Program Participation) panel data set to estimate heterogenous treatment effects from the 2008 stimulus program on housholds' short term labor supply response.
I follow papers like Parker (2017) (10.1257/mac.20150331) and Powell (2020) (https://doi.org/10.1086/704494).
